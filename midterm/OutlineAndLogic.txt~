OUTLINE:
- I will need the following constants: federal tax rate, state tax rate, city tax rate, FICA tax rate.
- I will need the following arrays: employee ID, hours worked, pay rate, gross pay- federal taxes, state tax, city tax, school tax, fica tax, net pay.
- I will use for loops to iterate, so that I can easily iterate through the arrays in parralel.
- Because of data validation I am going to create two functions to hold the logic for getting employee pay rate and employee hours. That will help keep the code clean and easier for me to get this done.
- Dont forget to call the <array> header.

LOGIC:
// Declare my headers
iostream and array
// Create function prototypes
double getPayRate()
int getHours()

MAIN FUNCTION:
// Declare the constants
FEDERAL = .10
STATE = .0575
CITY = .0275
FICA = 0.62
// Declare all the arrays
empID = {5658845,4520125,7895122,8777541,8451277,1302850,7580489}
hours
pay
