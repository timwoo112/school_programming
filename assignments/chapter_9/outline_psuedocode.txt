OUTLINE:
- What variables will I need:
  - A dynamically allocated array of integers for number of movies each student saw.
  - A integer to hold how many people are represented in the array.
  - An integer variable to hold the mode value.
  - Two double variables to hold the median and average.
- Functions:
  - I have been provided two functions calcMedian() and calcMode(). I will need to create a calcAverage(). It should take two parameters, the array and array size.
  - calcAverage() should return the average of the array.

PSEUDOCODE:
START main()
// Declaring variables
declare maxsize of array variable, mode, median, and average.

// Logic
- Ask user to enter how many students were surveyed store the number of students surveyed in the max size variable.
- Create the dynamic array based on the max variable input from the user.
- calcMedian() to find the median number of movies
  - Print out the median
- calcMode() to find the mode of movies watched
  - If the calcMode() function returned -1 then print, "There was no mode"
  - Else print out the mode.
- calcAverage() to find the average of movies watched.
  - Print out the average.
END main()

START calcAverage(array pointer, number of spots in array) - Accepts a pointer to the array and the number of spots in array
- Declare average and total variables.
- Loop through the array and add each value towards the total variable.
- Set average equal to the total / number of spots in the array.
- Return average.
END calcAverage

calcMedian and calcMode already provided!
